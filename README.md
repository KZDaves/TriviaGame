#Random Trivia

##Overview

Random Trivia is a web-based trivia game, wherein a player is asked a series of questions on assorted topics. The player has 4 possible answers from which to choose and 30 seconds to select one of them.

After the player has selected their answer to the question, the page will tell them if they were right or wrong. If incorrect, the correct answer will be displayed. If the player does not choose an answer at all, the timer will run out and the page will display the correct answer. 

After the player has had an opportunity to answer every question, the page will display their score. The score includes correct, incorrect, and unanswered tallies. The player then has the option to restart the game.
